# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

## Learning Objectives
* **What is a hash function**
* **What makes a good hash function**
* **What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them**
* **What is collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table**
* **What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables**
* **What are the most common use cases of hash tables**

## Additional Info
* **Hash functions are used to build caches for large data sets stored in slow media**
* **A good hash function satisfies two basic properties**
    - It should be very fast to compute
    - it should minimize duplication of output values(hash codes) i.e collisions
